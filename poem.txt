The rainbow

Purple
Blue
Red
Yellow
Green
Pink

These are the colors of the Rainbow



Now There are unicorns too.
And they are the happiest creatures of all.
Happy Forever.

No need to Worry
Because Nothing matters in the end
Live Happily


Unicorns are a specie of Horses.



Happy and SAD
Because That's Life
Life is Harsh


Never Easy

I am adding this myself
No Original. I was just curious about the poem.
